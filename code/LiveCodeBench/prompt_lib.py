[reflection 1]:
The implementation will fail when no subarray fulfills the condition. The issue in the implementation is due to the use of >= instead of > in the condition to update the result. Because of this, it returns a subarray even when the sum is greater than the target, as it still updates the result when the current subarray length is equal to the previous longest subarray length. To overcome this error, we should change the condition to only update the result when the current subarray length is strictly greater than the previous longest subarray length. This can be done by replacing >= with > in the condition.

[reflection 2]:
The implementation has an issue stemming from the while loop `while current_sum + nums[right] <= target:`, which directly accesses `nums[right]` without checking if right is within the bounds of the list. This results in a runtime error when right goes beyond the list length. To overcome this error, we need to add a bounds check for the right variable in the mentioned while loop. We can modify the loop condition to `while right < len(nums) and current_sum + nums[right] <= target:`. This change will ensure that we only access elements within the bounds of the list, thus avoiding the IndexError."""

[code review 1]:
- **Efficiency**: Efficient use of the sliding window technique.
- **Correctness**: Correct but updates `result` even for subarrays of equal max length, which could be optimized.
- **Readability**: Clear variable names; adding comments would improve understanding.
- **Edge Cases**: Consider adding checks for empty lists or negative targets.

[code review 2]:
- **Correctness**: Potential `IndexError` due to the initial loop exceeding list bounds.
- **Efficiency**: Redundant initial loop, could be simplified.
- **Readability**: Good variable naming, but initial loop adds unnecessary complexity.
- **Consistency**: Inconsistent update condition for `max_length` compared to the first implementation.
- **Edge Cases**: Similar to the first, needs checks for edge cases and error handling."""

From the docstring, the formatting of each line is done in a way that distributes the spaces between words as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces cannot be evenly distributed, the extra spaces are added from left to right.
For a line with only one word, the remaining spaces are added to the end of the line. The last line is left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words. Any remaining spaces are added to the end of the line.
